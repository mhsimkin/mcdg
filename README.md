Mermaid Class Diagram Generator (mcdg)
==================================================

## What is mcdg

mcdg (Mermaid Class Diagram Generator) is a dotnet tool for generating mermaid.js class diagrams directly from C# source code (`.cs` files).

Unlike other tools that require compiled assemblies (DLLs), `mcdg` uses Roslyn to parse your source code files recursively from a directory. This allows you to generate diagrams for projects that may not currently build or to quickly visualize a folder of scripts.

## Credits

This project is a source-code analysis port of [dll2mmd](https://github.com/rtfs/dll2mmd).
The core graph generation logic and structure were originally written by [rtfs](https://github.com/rtfs), and this project adapts that logic to work with the `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis` (Roslyn) API instead of reflection.

## Installing mcdg

1. Install .Net SDK 6.0 or later.
2. Install mcdg as a global dotnet tool.

    ```shell
    $ dotnet tool install --global mcdg
    You can invoke the tool using the following command: mcdg
    Tool 'mcdg' (version '1.0.0') was successfully installed.

   *Alternatively, if running from source:*
    ```shell
    $ dotnet run --project src/MermaidClassDiagramGenerator/MermaidClassDiagramGenerator.csproj -- [options]
    ```
